# Roadmap and Requirements

The intention of this application is to have an easily configurable and deployable clone of [noladiy.org](https://www.noladiy.org)
With the website being feature complete, it will be the best reference for how things should work.  There is non-public functionality
 that will require some reverse-engineering.

Notes

- No Forum included, the original is down and it doesn't seem like a good idea anyway
